For Lab 1, I developed my CSS3 for Google Chrome, thus I used the webkit.
I decided to run tweets and hashtags one an index basis from the json file.
I could have, alternatively, gotten all tweets and put them in one array, 
and all the hashtags in another, and looped through them. This would have allowed 
the hashtags to flow a constant rate.
